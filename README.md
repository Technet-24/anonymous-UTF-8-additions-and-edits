I have noticed recently that some of my analytic files or options have been messed with by someone. I'm not fluent in computer language, so I'm not sure whether or not the changes to my log are positive ones or negative ones that make my device and info vulnerable. I don't have a clue of what to do, so I thought it best to leave it up to the experts.
